# DAC to the Future: Multi-Mode Educational Analog Chip Proposal for IEEE SSCS Chipathon 2025 MOSbius Track
This is our chip proposal (DACFUTURE-EDU) for the SSCS PICO Design Contest (Chipathon 2025) in the MOSbius track. The chip extends the original MOSbius concept to focus on power management circuits, enabling educational experiments in advanced analog IC design.

## Datasheet

### Functionality of Your Chip & Target Specs
DACFUTURE-EDU is a chip inspired by the original MOSbius, optimized for power management and analog circuit experiments in advanced IC design courses. It allows users to configure and test CMOS transistors in power-related topologies (e.g., LDOs, BGRs) via a programmable switch matrix, enabling rapid prototyping without full tapeouts.
- **Core Functionality**: Reconfigurable 2-stage OTA as the central building block, combinable with peripherals for experiments like MOS characteristics, single-stage amplifiers, compensated OTAs, BGRs, LDOs, and oscillators.
- **Added Features**:

## Functionality of Building Blocks
- **2-Stage OTA (Core)**: Amplifies differential signals; configurable gain/bandwidth; supports Miller compensation for stability experiments.
- **4-Bit DAC**: Generates programmable voltages (e.g., for LDO setpoint or BGR trimming); used in switching experiments.
- **Programmable VCO**: Voltage-tunable ring oscillator.
- **Programmable RC Oscillator**: RC-based relaxation oscillator.
- **BGR (Bandgap Reference)**: Provides stable voltage reference; combinable with OTA.
- **LDO (Low-Dropout Regulator)**: Regulates output voltage; uses OTA in error amp; experiments on dropout, load regulation.

These enable modular experiments, e.g., combining OTA + BGR + LDO for a full power supply circuit.
